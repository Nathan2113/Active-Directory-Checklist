when you need to get local admin on a machine this tools is goated

- when you do “systeminfo” on a machine, it’ll tell you if there have been any hotfixes applied, if not then the machine is probably vulnerable to various kernel exploits
  
this one worked best for me
- pip install wesng
  
then you can just do
- wes sysinfo.txt
